## Analysis Overview

We were tasked with constructing two tables. One to determine the number of retiring employees per their job title. Also to identify employess who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The first table consisted of employee numbers, their first and last name. As well as their job titles and the time period they held that position. For the second table we collected the same data and added employee birth dates.


## Results

  * There are currently 72,458 employees that are going to retire.
